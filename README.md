# Chatbot-using-PDF-document-
The project aims to create a conversational chatbot that responds to user inquiries using PDF document information. 
It requires proficiency in extracting and converting text into numerical vectors, establishing an answer-finding mechanism, and designing a user-friendly chatbot
interface with Gradio. Additionally, the initiative emphasizes structuring inquiries for clear communication and deploying the chatbot for practical use, guaranteeing the system's accessibility and efficiency in meeting user needs. To develop a conversational chatbot, it must answer queries about
Nestl√©'s HR reports efficiently. Use Python libraries, OpenAI's GPT model, and Gradio UI. These tools will help you create a user-friendly interface. This interface will extract and process information from documents. It will provide accurate responses to user queries. 

**Action**
1. Import essential tools and set up OpenAI's API environment.
2. Load Nestle's HR policy using PyPDFLoader and split it for easy processing.
2. Create vector representations for text chunks using Chroma dB and OpenAI's embeddings.
3. Build a question-answering system using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to retrieve answers from text chunks.
4. Create a prompt template to guide the chatbot in understanding and responding to users.
5. Use Gradio to build a user-friendly chatbot interface, enabling interaction and information retrieval.
